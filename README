| LANGUAGE RUBY |
-----------------

Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto,
blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp)
to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.
Ruby is also completely free. Not only free of charge, but also free to use, copy,
modify, and distribute.
